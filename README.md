SuperSea is a web browser extension that adds extra features to OpenSea:

- View floor prices inline with items, and calculate the total floor value for a profile's collection.
- Force fetch asset images from source, to view them seconds after reveal instead of waiting for OpenSea to update.
- Handy quick actions to view an assets raw metadata, and queue it to be updated on OpenSea.
- Avoid bundle scams with the bundle verification banner.
- **Members only:** View rarity ranks of all items inline. No need to navigate and cross reference from other ranking websites.

And many more features to come!
