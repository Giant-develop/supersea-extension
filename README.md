# SuperSea

SuperSea is a web browser extension that adds extra features to OpenSea: 

* View floor prices inline with items, and calculate the total floor value for a profile's collection.
* Force fetch asset images  from source, to view them seconds after reveal instead of waiting for OpenSea to update.
* Handy quick actions to view an assets raw metadata, and queue it to be updated on OpenSea. 
* Avoid bundle scams with the bundle verification banner. 
* **Members only:** View rarity ranks of all items inline. No need to navigate and cross reference from other ranking websites. 

And many more features to come!
